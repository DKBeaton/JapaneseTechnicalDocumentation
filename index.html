        <p>
          <b>Nouns</b>
          can be one of the easiest words to learn in Japanese. However, memorizing over 6,000 words isn't an easy
          task. When you learn nouns, you create a framework that is paired with grammar to express the things we want
          to talk about.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also introduce
          <b>pronouns</b>, which are words that indirectly refer to people, direction, and things that require context
          to be properly understood.
        </p>
        <h2>Nouns</h2>
        <p>
          In simple terms, a
          <b>noun</b>
          <code><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>名詞<rt>めいし</rt></ruby></span></code>
          represents a person, place, state, quality, event, or thing. In Japanese, nouns have no number or gender.
          This means that there is no distinction between singular and plural forms or masculine and feminine forms.
          There is also no articles like "a", "an", or "the" that accompany nouns like in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table shows the most common nouns in Japanese. These words are written with the most basic
          Kanji<code><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>漢字<rt>かんじ</rt></ruby></span></code> that are taught early on in Japanese education.

          <b>Grammar Note</b>: Making nouns plural, although not common, is still possible. One method involves the
          suffix<span class="japanese"

          (living)

          In English, a proper noun is a noun that indicates an individual person, place, organization, etc. and is
          spelled with an initial capital letter. In Japanese, words are not capitalized, but the concept of a proper
          noun <code><span class="japanese"

          <h2>Loanwords</h2>
        </header>

        <p>A <b>loanword</b> is a word borrowed from another lanuage. Loanwords in Japanese are called <code><span
                  class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>外来語<rt>がいらいご</rt></ruby></span></code> and are
          typically borrowed from modern languages in the last two to three centuries. Words borrowed from the Chinese
          language during it's development are called <code><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>漢語<rt>かんご</rt></ruby></span></code> and are treated separately. Words that came in
          recent
          centuries are treated as <span class="japanese"
                lang="ja"><ruby>外来語<rt>がいらいご</rt></ruby></span>.
        </p>

        <p>The vast majority of loanwords come from English. We must remember to treat these loanwords as Japanese
          words. This means you can't simpy pronounce it as if it were English. Some examples can be found in the
          following table.

        <p>A <b>pronoun</b> <span class="japanese"
                lang="ja"><ruby>代名詞<rt>だいめいし</rt></ruby></span> indirectly refers to an entity that involves a person,
          direction, or thing. The meaning of said entity is determined by context. For instance, proper names are
          pronouns because they stand in place of the actual person/thing they reference. Proper names can also be
          shared with others or other things, and so we need context to truly understand what is meant by saying the
          name "Seth"</p>

        <p>Words like "here" and "there" or even words like "this" and "that" are pronouns. This is becasue no one can
          ascertain what they refer to without context.</p>

        <p>Generally when we think of pronouns, we think of pronouns that are used to establish grammatical person. The
          following tables show the distinctions in English of grammatical person.</p>

        <table>
          <caption>
            Table: Grammatical person in English.

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Gender and number both play a role in English in determining what grammatical person is used in a sentence.
          However, in Japanese there isn't a single pronoun that corresponds to each of the pronouns for grammatical
          person. This means there is more than one word for "I", "we", etc. This is beacuse all pronouns in Japanese
          started out as typical nouns, or were far vaguer pronouns that didn't match up with grammatical person.
        </p>

        <p>In Japanese, pronouns differ by their politeness and by who actually uses them. Many pronouns are reserved
          for whether the speaker is male or female, or whether the person is young or old. Dialects also effect which
          pronouns are used.</p>

        <p>The following pronouns listed in the table below are the most essential.</p>

        <p><b>Usage Notes</b>: </p>

        <ol>
          <li><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja">わたくし</span> is the respectful form of <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>私<rt>わたし</rt></ruby></span>. Typically <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja">わたし</span> will suffice in most
            situtations. However, "I" is often
            dropped altogether. As long as it's known that the sentence is about oneself, there is no need to use the
            pronoun "I".</li>
          <li><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>僕<rt>ぼく</rt></ruby></span> is another pronoun for "I" and is used heavily by male
            speakers, both young and old.</li>
          <li>There are many pronouns for "you", but the most neutral in terms of politeness and purpose is <span
                  class="japanese"
                  lang="ja">あなた</span>.
            However it is also typically dropped from most sentences. It is inherently direct, which is a quality not
            typically found in statments directed at others. Second person statments are rarely stated in absolute
            terms, usually referring to others in third person.</li>
          <li><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja">あなた</span> may be used as a term of endearment to refer to one's male
            partner/spouse, both when one is happy
            and mad at one's significant other.</li>
          <li>In casual settings, the pronouns <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>彼<rt>かれ</rt></ruby></span> and <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>彼女<rt>かのじょ</rt></ruby></span> may respectively mean "boyfriend" and "girlfriend".
          </li>
          <li>The plural form of <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>彼<rt>かれ</rt></ruby></span>, <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>彼<rt>かれ</rt></ruby>ら</span> uses the <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja">ら</span> suffix making it plural.</li>
          <li><span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>彼<rt>かれ</rt></ruby>ら</span> may refer to a group of people with both men and women,
            but <span class="japanese"
                  lang="ja"><ruby>彼女<rt>かのじょ</rt></ruby>たち</span> only refers to groups of women.</li>
          <li>The pronoun "it" is omitted because it's combined in Japanese with the concept of "that".</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In English, pronouns change form depending on their grammatical purpose in a sentence. In grammar, this is
          called grammatical case. Pronouns change the most in English depending on their case. An example is "my" which
          is the possessive form of "I".</p>

        <p>In Japanese, grammatical case is marked by the use of "case particles". Case particles take the place of form
          change to noun/pronouns to indicate what function the word has in the sentence. For pronouns, there are two
          grammatical cases you should know about: nominative and possessive.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Nominative Case (subjective): Noun/pronoun used as the subject of the sentence (person or thing that is
            doing an action).</li>
          <li>Possessive Case: Noun/pronoun form that shows ownership of one noun by another.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>I am an America man. (I = nominative)</li>
          <li>Your dog is adorable. (Your = possessive)</li>
          <li>We are scientists. (We = nominative)</li>
          <li>Our goal is world peace. (Our = possessive)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The subject of a sentence is the person/thing that performs an action or exhibits some description which is
          what the sentence is about. By adding a case particle to a noun/pronoun we express these grammatical concepts.
          We add <span class="japanese"
                lang="ja">が</span> to the noun/pronoun for nominative cases. We use <span class="japanese"
                lang="ja">の</span> for possessive cases. The following table shows examples of
          these cases.

        <p>When speaking about entities <b>physically visible</b>, there is a three-way distinction made based on the
          proximity
          of the entity from the speaker and listener. When the entity discussed is <b>not physically visible</b>, there
          is a
          two-way distinction made based on who knows abut the entity in question. The criterion then becomes whether
          only the speaker knows about the entity or if both the speaker and listener(s) know about it.</p>
